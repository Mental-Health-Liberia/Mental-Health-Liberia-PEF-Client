This project is a part of the Computing for Good class led by [Ellen Zegura](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ewz/Welcome.html) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu).

# How to Run
This project requires that node.js, grunt, and bower must be installed.

You can install grunt and bower by running: `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`.

Next, install the dependencies for the project (both node modules and CSS/JS):

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Then build the project: `grunt build`.

And run the server via `node server.js`.

You're done!
