# Mental Health Liberia - Client
This is the client / web frontend for the Patient Encounter Form system. It relies on the [backend](https://github.com/Tanner/Mental-Health-Liberia-PEF-Server) to submit forms.

The web app is a static site which can be served on any static web server.

## Background
